    is holding your watch up to your shoulder, yet it is recommended that you set your own gesture. To do this,
    place your phone down and sit in your regular cycling position. Hold your wrist in a gesture position that feels comfortable
    to you (We advise a position which will not be easily mistaken by the application). Then press the set
    gesture button.</string>

    <string name="about">The aim of this application is to deduce how quickly an accurately a gesture can be conducted using a smart watch.
        To use this application, change the gesture to something which feels comfortable, this can be done through accessing the menu in the top right.
        Next, press the start button. Once the start button has been pressed the watch will vibrate. This begins the evaluation. Within 5-10 seconds the watch will vibrate again; signalling
    you to conduct your gesture. This will happen a total of 4 times. After the test is complete, an email will be sent to the evaluator with stats envolving the evaluation.</string>
